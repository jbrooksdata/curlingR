# curlingR: Accessible world curling data

`curlingR` seeks to preserve world curling data and maintain its usability for researchers and other enthusiasts in the sports data space. As media coverage of this sport can be limited in many locations, this package will make it much easier for coaches, players, and other enthusiasts to analyze matches and deepen their understanding of the sport.

`curlingR` utilizes API access to [DoubleTakeout](https://doubletakeout.com/), a world curling data website and blog, to archive men’s and women’s world rankings, game logs, shot logs, and other event info, primarily for events from 2018 through present day, with some game and shot log data dating back to 2001 for major events like the Olympics and World Championships.

## Installation

`sweepR` can be installed using:

```
devtools::install_github("jbrooksdata/sweepR")
```

## Other Notes

- Browse [the curlingR data repo](https://github.com/jbrooksdata/curlingR-data) for raw data.
